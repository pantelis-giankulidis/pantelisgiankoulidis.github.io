      <p class="p-3 pe-5 text-center maintext">
        I graduated as an Electrical and Computer engineer from the Technical University of Crete in 2023. During my studies there,
        i created several projects focusing on computer and software engineering, the carrer path i am actually taking.</br>
        As an undergraduate student there, i was a member for more than a year of the traffic fluid project. The traffic fluid project 
        focuses on autonomous vehicular mobility on environments where the stakeholders are fully or partially autonomous 
        vehicles. Some of my contributions to the program include the proposal of an imporvement to the artificial potential fields, which
        is the area arround a vehicle where when another vehicle enters, it is more likely for a collision between them. The lane-free traffic 
        environment requires more complex calculations for the artificial potential fields compare to the traditional traffic environment, 
        because the vehicles can take any place in the road, they are not only inbound a lane.</br>
        </p>

        <p class="p-3 pe-5 text-center maintext">
          I am working as a software engineer for about three years. I have been designing and implementing software solutions for a variety 
          of products, in two different engineering teams. I have worked in most of my time in the software projects i was involved with Spring boot in Java, with python, SQL 
          typescript in React and angular. Both my work occupations were for full-stack engineers.
          I have also solid knowledge of C++, the language i used to create and develop my thesis project. I have also
          worked on several personal software projects using C++ and Python.
        </p>
        
        <p class="p-3 pe-5 text-center maintext">
        My general technology and future career interests include Reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques and their uses in real world
        useful
        applications. I have a very strong knowledge of database systems and i am
        particularly interested to be involved in software projects about training and deploying
        intelligent ML,DL and RL systems
        in larger projects.
