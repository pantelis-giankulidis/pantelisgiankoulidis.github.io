      <p class=" p-3 pe-5 text-center maintext">I was an undergraduate student at the
        Technical
        University of
        Crete(TUC), studying at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department in an integrated 5-year Bachelor and
        Master program, where
        the first 4 years are undergraduate level courses and a successful participation in the fifth year leads to a
        Master's degree. I successfully
        received the Master of Science degree in 2023.</p>
      <p class="text-center maintext">
        As an undergaduate student, i was a member of the traffic fluid
        project, a
        European Research Council grant, from September 2021 until January 2023. The research program is running by two
        laboratories at the Technical University
        of Crete,
        with collaboration with professors and post-docs in other universities.

      <p class="text-center columnTitle">ABOUT MY INTERESTS AND GOALS</p>
      <p class="p-3 pe-5 text-center" style="font-family: Geneva;color:#fefefa">
        My main interests include Reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques and their uses in real world
        useful
        applications. I have a very strong knowledge of database systems and i am
        particularly interested in using database systems as a back-end software engineer, for training and deploying
        intelligent ML,DL and RL systems
        in larger projects.
      </p>
      <p class="p-3 pe-5 text-center maintext">
        I have a strong knowledge of C++, the language i used to create and develop my thesis project. I have also
        worked on several projects using C++ and
        i would really enjoy working as a back-end software engineer for simulators and games with this technology.
